Database project made using Java, MySQL and Netbeans.

## Description
The project required that I create a business scenario in which I needed to create an application usuing my knowledge of databases, SQL, and Java programming to make the business process easier for the user.

My project featured very basic features and reports and I had just covered what was required in the scope of the project and didn't have time to do any extras or add any advanced features to the project. Overall I achieved an excellent mark for the project.
